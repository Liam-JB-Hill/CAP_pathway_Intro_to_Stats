**Overview**

Whilst Session 1 (this morning) gave you the skills to describe your data, this 
workshop moves on to look at how you can use your data to make inferences 
(i.e. how to use data to test statistical hypotheses). 

We will focus on training you to run and interpret the output from three basic 
kinds of statistical tests. 

* Firstly, we will look at bivariate correlation tests (useful when studying relationships between pairs of continuous variables).
* Then we will take a look at t-tests (used to test for group differences in a continuously measured outcome). 
* Lastly, we will look at chi-squared tests (helpful for testing relationships between variables that are both measured categorically).Â

*Note:* At the end of each section I've also included some 'things to do next' advice.
