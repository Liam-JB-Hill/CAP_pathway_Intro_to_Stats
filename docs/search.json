We will NOT have time to go through installing it on the day, so please find time to do this beforehand.\nThe University has procedures that will allow you to request and install a FREE personal copy of this software. Further instructions on how to do this can be found at this Information Services Webpage: https://information-services.ed.ac.uk/computing/desktop-personal/software/main-software-deals/spss/spss-staff-and-students"
