**Overview**

In this session we will discuss the theory underpinning inferential statistical 
methods. 

To begin, we will explain how statistical methods are used to model our predictions 
(i.e. our hypotheses) and how samples of data, from a larger population, are 
then used to test the goodness of fit between our "predicted models" and the 
actual data we have collected (i.e. does our data support our predictions?). 

In particular, there will be a focus on helping you understanding the concepts of 
'significance' and 'meaningfulness'. This will involve you learning a bit about 
what 'p-values' (for Null Hypothesis Significance tests) and Effect Sizes 
represent and getting opportunities to practice interpreting such values.
